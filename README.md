# Task 1 - Card Slider

## Setup Instructions

1. Clone the repository to your local machine:
  - git clone https://github.com/sohanshrestha12/Card-Slider.git
2. Navigate into the project folder:
  - cd slider
3. Inside html folder open the `index.html` file in your browser, or run a local server to view the demo.

## Technology Choices and Rationale

- **HTML/CSS/JavaScript**: I chose to use plain HTML, CSS, and JavaScript for simplicity and to demonstrate core web development skills.
- **CSS Flexbox**: Used for layout purposes in the slider for easy alignment and responsiveness.
- **Smooth Scrolling**: Implemented using JavaScript for a better user experience, ensuring the card closest to the center of the slider becomes active and smoothly scrolls into place.

## Known Limitations/Trade-offs

- **Performance**: The current implementation may not scale well for a large number of cards as the scroll event can become performance-intensive.
- **Browser Compatibility**: The smooth scrolling might not be supported in all older browsers.
- **Styling**: The styling is kept simple and may not be as polished as a production-ready UI.

## Future Improvements

- **Lazy Loading**: Implement lazy loading for cards to improve performance when the list of cards grows larger.
- **Mobile Optimization**: Further refine the UI for mobile devices, including improving swipe gestures.

## Time Spent on the Project

- Approximately **5 hours** were spent on implementing the functionality, testing, and refining the design.
